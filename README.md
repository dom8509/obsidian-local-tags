# Local Tags

With this plugin you get an additional panel that shows all tags of the current markdown file. 

The plugin is not yet available in [Obsidian Community Plugins](https://obsidian.md/plugins) but you can install it with `BRAT` for now.

After install, open command palette to enable this plugin, then the views will be default registered in the right panel. 

```bash
Enable Command: "Local Tags: Enable Plugin"
